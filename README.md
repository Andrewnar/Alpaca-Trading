# Automated Trading System using Alpaca API

This automated trading system is designed to allow traders to buy and sell stocks using the Alpaca API. The system will use advanced algorithms and market data analysis to generate trade signals and execute trades in real-time.

## Prerequisites
- An Alpaca account and API key (https://alpaca.markets/)
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- A development environment such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<project-directory>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <"Project Directory">`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create a file named `secrets.py` in the root directory and add the following code:

```python
api_key = "<API KEY>"
secret_key = "<SECRET KEY>"
```
Replace `<your Alpaca API key>` and `<your Alpaca secret key>` with your actual Alpaca API and secret keys.

## Usage
1. Start the trading system by running the following command in the terminal: python `main.py`
2. The system will begin collecting market data and analyzing it to generate trade signals.
3. Trades will be executed based on the generated signals and the status of the trades can be monitored through the user interface.
